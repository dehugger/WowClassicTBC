# Coffee's School for Rogues Who Read Gud (Alliance 58 > 70)

## Talents

### Sublety Ambush Weapon Swap
Good for Solo Questing

 - 58    > [8/0/41](https://tbc.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/3203--0500531302301210501351)
 - 59:61 > Master of Sublety
 - 62:63 > Malice
 - 64    > Relentless Strikes
 - 64:67 > Malice
 - 68:69 > Murder/Improved Expose Armor/Lethality
 - 70    > Respec!

### Combat
Good for groups/killing elites
Avoid taking a weapon specialization so that you can use whatever you find along the way.
Shift two talents from Blade Twisting to Improved Kick if you prefer. Blade Twisting is nice for kiting, Improved Kick is nice for fighting elites and dungeons.

 - 58    > [8/41/0](https://tbc.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/0233-025305202005010022301251)
 - 59:60 > Malice
 - 61    > Relentless Strikes
 - 62:67 > Lethality
 - 68:69 > Murder
 - 70    > Respec!
 
## Stat Priority

 - Expertise: If you can get it, take it. You can't have to much of this when leveling.
 - Hit Rating: If Combat, stack as much of this as you can get your hands on. If Sublety aim for 6-9%. The lower level mobs require less hit.
 - Agility: Gives attack power (1:1), critical strike, dodge chance, and armor. It's a rogue's best friend.
 - Critical Strike: Crits are good, but not as important as other classes. Your Ambush is getting the vast majority of its crit percentage from talents.
 - Attack Power/Strength: These are even priority. Makes you hit harder. Good stat.
 - Stamina: Health is important.
 - Everything Else: Garbage stat dont waste time thinking about it.

## Consumes
Leveling consumes are very cheap and make playing solo significantly easier.

 - Level First Aid to 325 so you can use Heavy Netherweave Bandage. This almost entirely eliminates the need to eat food for HP.
 - Figluster's Mudfish (+20 Agi) *or* Spicy Hot Talbuk (+20 Hit Rating)
 - Elixir of Greater Agility (+25 Agi available very cheap)
 - Elixir of Major Fortitude (+250 HP and 10 hp/5, usually quite cheap)
 - Use an Adamantite or Fel Iron Sharp/Weighstone on your mainhand when solo. This outperforms instant poison.
 - Use Deadly Poison on offhand. If you are fighting casters, use Mind-Numbing Poison.
 
## Weapons
This is primarily oriented towards quest rewards, however dungeon items are called out where applicable.

For Main Hand weapons you want a slow weapon that hits very hard, with good stats. If you have racial bonuses it may be worth skipping the fist weapons.

For Off Hand weapons you want something that hits as fast as possible. This is true for every rogue spec *except* Mutilate (which is a meme spec dont use it). Faster is better, as it applies poison quicker and generates more Combat Potency energy (if you are combat spec). Weapon DPS is a secondary consideration after speed and stats.

For Ambush Dagger's you want the hardest hitting dagger you can get.

At level 64 you get Deadly Throw. I highly recommend using a thrown weapon from this point forward, as it is an excellent solo ability and allows you to easily finish off mobs that run away, or to slow mobs while you kite them.

### Notable BoEs
Fist of Reckoning is the only BoE really worth getting. The quest Offhand and Ambush daggers are all very, very good.

 - Fist of Reckoning (61 Mace): You can use this until Nexus-Claw. Very good. Maybe expensive, as Enhancement Shamans all want this badly.

### Main-hand Slow Weapon (Sinister Strike and Hemorrhage)
Slower is better. If you are human prioritize getting a Fist of Reckoning.

 - Foe Reaver (58 Sword): Quest - (A)The Path of Anguish *or* (H)Felspark Ravine in Hellfire Peninsula
	You can use this as soon as you get to Outland. You have to choose between this or Screaming Dagger.
 - Warden's Hammer (60 Mace): Quest - Escape from Umbrafen in Zangarmarsh
	This is actually superior to both Shadowrend Longblade and Footman's Longsword. Get this as soon as you can.
 - Sporeling Claw (63 Fist Weapon): Quest - Fhwoor Smash! in Zangarmarsh
	There are better weapons you can get between this and the next, however the difference is not substantial enough to really matter.
 - Nexus-Claw (66 Fist Weapon): Vendor BoE - Sold by Dealer Jadyan in Netherstorm.
	This hits very hard, has excellent stats, and is easy to acquire. There isn't anything else readily available that beat's this until 70.
	
### Main-hand Dagger (Ambush)

 - Screaming Dagger (58): Quest - (A)The Path of Anguish *or* (H)Felspark Ravine in Hellfire Peninsula
	You can use this as soon as you get to Outland. You have to choose between this or Foe Reaver.
	If you picked Foe Reaver, get a green melee dagger that is 1.7 or 1.8 speed. The stats are not very important compared to the damage.
 - Akuno's Blade (62): Quest -  Escaping the Tomb in Terokkar Forest
	This is almost identical to Wastewalker Shiv from Slavepens, and is a fairly easy quest reward.
	There are better blues between this and the next item, but the difference is very small and not worth going out of your way for.
 - Adamantite Dagger (65): Crafted Blacksmith BoE
	This is a cheap crafted. It hits hard and has decent stats.
 - Ceremonial Warmaul Blood-blade (65): Quest - The Ring of Blood in Nagrand
	You will probably do Ring of Blood at some point for the XP. This is a good dagger if you get it right at 65.
 - Nether-Stalker's Blade (67): Quest - Teleport This! in Netherstorm
	Hits very hard, expertise, a lot of AP. Very good and easy to get.
 - Twin-Bladed Ripper (68): Quest - Nexus-King Salhadaar in Netherstorm.
	Absolutely phenomanal dagger, incredible stats. Nearly worth using over harder hitting mainhands like Nexus-Claw.
	Use this till 70.
	
### Off-hands (All specs)
The 4 listed daggers are incredible and beat out any alternatives until Blackout Truncheon.

 - Hellfire Skiver (58 Dagger): Quest - (A)Fel Orc Scavengers or (H)Bonechewer Blood in Hellfire Peninsula
	1.4 speed, has hit, available immediatly. Get this.
 - Blood-Guided Knife (62 Dagger): Quest - Escape from Firewing Point! in Terokkar Forest
	1.3 speed, has hit, has expertise, and a lot of stam. This is Hellfire Skiver's bigger, cooler, better brother.
 - Vibro Shanker (65 Dagger): Quest - Cutting your Teeth in Blade's Edge Mountains.
	1.4 speed, expertise, a boat-load of attack power and agility. This is the spiritual successor to the first two daggers.
 - Pulse Dagger (66 Dagger): Vendor BoE - Sold by Dealer Jadyan in Netherstorm.
	1.3 speed with a ton of hit. Only worth using over Vibro Shanker if you are very hit starved.
 - Blackout Truncheon (68 Mace): Dungeon - Grandmaster Vorpil (Shadow Labyrinth)
	Good damage, 2 gem slots, and a great haste proc. This is the best offhand available until 70. Doubley good if you are human.
	You can pair this with Fist of Reckoning, Terokk's Nightmare, or Master Smith's Hammer for combat bonk-spec (mace specialization).
	
### Ranged
Highly, highly recommend you only use thrown from 64>70, as Deadly Throw is incredible.

 - 58 to 61: Get a BoE green or Legion Blunderbuss from Blood Furnace.
	Do *not* waste your quest reward on Ironstar Repeater. Hellfire Skiver is 100x better.
 - Expedition Repeater (62 Crossbow): Quest - Colassal Menace in Hellfire Peninsula
	Not much to say. Its a crossbow with stats.
 - Coilfang Needler (62 Crossbow): Dungeon - Rokmar the Crackler (The Slave Pens)
	More AP then Expedition Repeater. Not worth going out of your way for, but its there.
 - Needle Shrike (63 Thrown): Dungeon - Hungarfen (The Underbog)
	Hit, AP, and thrown. Only worth going for if you dont want to wait/grind several hundred animals in Nagrand.
 - Fitz' Throwing Axe (64 Thrown): Quest - The Ultimate Bloodsport in Nagrand
	Excellent stats. Very very long quest chain. At 2.2 speed this is the slowest thrown weapon in the game. This makes Deadly Throw hit harder.
	There is nothing better then this until level 70. Grind for it.
	
## Trinkets

 - Bladefist's Breadth (58): Quest - Overlord in Hellfire Peninsula
	This is a miniature Bloodlust Brooch. You will use it until 70, so prioritize getting it as soon as possible.
	Superior to both of the subsequent trinkets from Terokkar Forest.
	If you are Combat, macro this to your Blade Flurry.
 - Terrokar Tablet of Precision (63): Quest - Torgos! in Terokkar Forest
	+Hit with a short cooldown AP active.
	Get this if you are Combat.
 - Ancient Dranei War Talisman (63): Quest - The Vengeful Harbinger in Terrokar Forest
	+Crit and a much stronger AP active.
	Get this if you Sublety
 - Core of Ar'kelos (67): Quest - Ar'kelos the Gaurdian in Netherstorm
	Haste active is very good, and gives a lot of AP.
	Replace Tablet of Precision or War Talisman with this.
	
## Macros

Basic Sinister Strike/Hemorrhage attack macro. This one is your bread and butter, and it eliminates the need to have "Auto Attack" on your keyboard:
```
#showtooltip
/startattack
/cast Hemorrhage; Sinister Strike
```

Ambush Weapon Swap. Replace the weapon name's with your main hand and ambush dagger. It will show the icon of the currently equipped mainhand.
```
#showtooltip 16
/equipslot 16 Weapon1
/equipslot 16 Weapon2
```

## Rotation

### Sublety Ambush

#### Single Target
 1. Equip Ambush Dagger (see macro above). If your ambush dagger is really bad use Ghostly Strike from stealth (Garrote does not benefit from crit).
 2. Enter Stealth. If Premeditate is up, use it.
 3. If Shadowstep is up, Shadowstep to mob, otherwise get behind it in stealth.
 4. Ambush, immediatly weapon-swap to your mainhand. If you want to be fancy you can macro this, but it can screw things up if you dont have enough energy for ambush.
 5. Hemorrhage until the mob is at 1/3 HP.
 6. Eviscerate, finish mob as needed.
 
 Now immediatly restealth and repeat on the next mob to make use of Remorseless Attacks crit buff. Do this until to low to safely continue, then bandage.
 
### Combat

#### Single Target
 1. Stealth is for nerds.
 2. Approach mob, Sinister Strike once.
 3. Slice & Dice.
 4. Sinister Strike until mob is 1/3-1/4 HP
 5. Eviscerate, finish mob as needed.
 
 Repeat on the next mob to make use of Remorseless Attacks crit buff. Do this until to low to safely continue, then bandage.
 
#### Multiple Targets / Elites

 1. Sinister Strike once
 2. Apply Slice & Dice
 3. Wait one energy tic
 4. Use Blade Flurry, Trinket, and Adrenaline Rush if it is up. I recommend macroing these together.
 5. Spam Sinister Strike like your life depends on it. 
 5a. If S&D falls off while Blade Flurry is active, keep Sinister Striking until Blade Flurry is done.
 5b. If you hit 4-5 Combos use Eviscerate with Blade Flurry is up.
 
 Use Evasion as needed to stay alive.
