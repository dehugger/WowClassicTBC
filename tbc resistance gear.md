# TBC Resistance Gear
## SSC
### [Mandatory] Hydross the Unstable
 - Tanks need 365 Res to Frost OR Nature (1 each)
 - 295 From Gear + Totem/Paladin Aura/Hunter Aspect
 - Materials list for the tank gear is kind of insane. Needs guild effort.
 
### [Mandatory] Leotheras the Blind
 - Warlock needs 365 Fire Resistance
 - 295 + Shaman Totem/Paladin Aura
 
## TK
### [Helpful] High Astromancer Solarian
 - Raid wide Arcane resistance
 - Violet Badge + MotW + Potion should be enough
 
## Hyjal
### [Very Helpful] Kaz'rogal
 - Raid wide Shadow Res to save caster mana, Clothy Shadow resistance to resist Mark
 - If mana users run out of mana with "Mark of Kaz'Rogal" they will literally blow up and kill us all
 - Blessed Medallian of Karabor + Night's End + Shadow Protection = 30% chance to resist the Mark
 
## BT
### [Mandatory] Mother Shahraz
 - Everyone but tanks needs 365 Shadow Resistance.
 - 295 + Paladin Aura
 - EVERYONE needs to prepare for this
 
### [Mandatory] Illidan Stormrage
 - Two tanks need 365 Fire Res for phase 2.
 - most of this is badge gear
 
## Sunwell
### [Very Helpful] Kalecgos
 - Raid wide arcane resistance
 - Violet Badge + Imp MotW + Cloak of Arcane Evasion w/ Resist Enchant should be enough
 - 125 Resist is the "sweet spot"
 
### [Helpful] Felmyst
 - Raid wide arcane resistance
 - Violet Badge + Arcane Pot should be enough to handle burst damage
